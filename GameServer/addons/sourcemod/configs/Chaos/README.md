# In-Game Config Editor

The command `!chaos` can be used in-game to edit effect's durations and the ability to disable them.

`!chaos ->  Settings -> Edit Effects`

**Changes you make will be saved into a new `Chaos_Override.cfg` flie in `addons/sourcemod/configs/Chaos/`, the settings in this config will override the default times compiled in the plugin, and can be deleted at any time to reset to defaults. This also means that you can update every file in the Chaos plugin when there's a new updating without losing the config**

You can adjust the effect titles in [the translation files](https://github.com/b0ink/csgo-chaos-mod/tree/main/addons/sourcemod/translations) to appear differently in-game, if the file is not present, it will use the titles set by the plugin.
