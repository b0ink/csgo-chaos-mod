Chaos Mod for CS:GO [102 EFFECTS]


Known Issues
- When all the effects reset (1 second after the round ends), a potential game crash occurs what seems to be when its dealing with a ragdoll/dead player.
  Seems to be when the player dies at the SAME time as the reset.
  
- Soccerball effect only works on Dust 2 (need to test precaching the soccerball on other maps);
